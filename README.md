As a user, I should be able to:

-sign up and create an account, so I can use the application.
-log in with the username and password I used to create the account, so I can access my account.
-log out, for security purposes.
-have access to an index page that allows me to create, read, update, and destroy (accounts, rental requests).
-see the total inventory that front-lines has on-hand.
-see requests I have made upon their creation.
-affect inventory total in real-time once permission to rent has been granted.


Things to fix:
Lost and broken system
