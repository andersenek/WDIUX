USER STORIES

As a user, I should be able to:

  -sign up and create an account, so I can use the application.
  -log in with the username and password I used to create the account, so I can access my account.
  -log out, for security purposes.
  -have access to an index page that allows me to create, read, update, and destroy (accounts, rental requests).
